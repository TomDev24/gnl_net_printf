--------//
Making GNL (without bonuses) required 3 rewrites.
I started small, with 1 byte read, and gradually increased functionality of programm
leaks were handled from the start.
//What i learned
1)leaks a.out -- tool to check leaks, valgrind has problem
2)getchar() from stdio.h allows to "fix" program
3)lldb - debug tool, same as gdb on linux
-> lldb --a.out params
